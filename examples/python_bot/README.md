# Python Bot

This is the simplest example of using Anderson.

Just run the following command:
```bash
anderson "python3 main.py" ./gifs ./config.yaml
```
And in the gifs folder you will get the following gifs:
- `light.gif`: 
  ![light.gif](gifs%2Flight.gif)
- `dark.gif`:
  ![dark.gif](gifs%2Fdark.gif)
